dir1. Create a folder on Desktop named "streamlit" and create a file named "my_app.py" inside it.

open conda terminal or command terminal and cd to this "streamlit" folder we have created

2. Create virtual environment

                              a. method 1: from anaconda promt

- to create conda environment:
   	conda create -n env_name 
   	conda env list

- to create conda environment with specific version of python (if you will install requirements.txt file, it is not recommended):
	conda create -n env_name python=3.9.16

- to create conda environment with pip
	conda create -n env_name pip

- to create conda environment with pip and specific version of python
	conda create -n python=3.7 env_name pip

- to activate environment:
   	conda activate env_name
  	source activate env_name (mac users)
  	
- to deactivate environment:
   	conda deactivate  (for windows users)
   	source deactivate (for mac users)

- to delete/remove environment with all packages:
   	conda remove --name env_name --all
       

                              b. method 2: from terminal (vscode, command promt, gitbash, mac terminal)

- to create environment:
   	python -m venv env_name (windows)
   	python3 -m venv env_name (mac terminal)

- to activate environment:
   	env_name/Scripts/activate (vscode)
   	source env_name/Scripts/activate (gitbash)
   	source env_name/bin/activate (mac terminal use "bin" instead of Scripts) 

- to deactivate environment:
   	deactivate (for vscode or gitbash)

- to delete/remove environment:
   	rm -rf env_name (for vscode, gitbash, mac users)

- If required install and upgrade pip package
	python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

  
 c. method 3 : from anaconda navigator

- create environment (by mouse)
- no activation required
- select environment we created and go Home page
- install jupyter Notebook into the environment and go back Environments page
- click on the green arrow next to the environment name and select "Open with Jupyter Notebook"
- upload your files here and open terminal
- run the following code on terminal to see all environments
     
  	conda install nb_conda_kernels

- close terminal and Jupyter Notebook and then go environment and reopen Jupyter Notebook on it
- open your ipynb file and select kernel
- open app file and start to work with them
  
  
3. add packages into venv

  a. method 1: 

   pip install streamlit==1.22.0
   pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2

or 
 
   b. method 2:       
   (if you already have requirements.txt file)
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    pip list (to see the packages we installed)
    pip freeze > requirements1.txt (to create requirements1.txt file)
   
   
    to see Python version: python -V

4. to run application file
   streamlit run my_app.py
